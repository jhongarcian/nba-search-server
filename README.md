# Assignment: NBA Search

Create a simple but fully functional application that allows users to search for an NBA MVP player by year or by name. This assignment requires both client and server code.

## HTML and CSS Requirements
* fully responsive beginning at 360px
* engaging design
* layout comprised of the sectioning elements `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` (these must be direct children of `<body>`)
* sticky footer
* a single input to search by name or year

## JavaScript Requirements
* a single event listener that can distinguish between search by name or search by year
* graceful error handling if the user attempts to search for a year or name that is not in the data

## Node Requirements
* a server built with Express that runs at port 8080
* an endpoint to respond to a request by name
* an endpoint to respond to a request by year

## Branching Strategy
* Since this is a solo project, you are allowed to push to `main` if you would like
